## Description
When I had a bad internet connection, I had trouble watching Twitch clips because Twitch would automatically switch the quality to a higher setting. This meant I had to manually lower it every time I opened a new tab with a Twitch clip. 

This extension automatically changes the Twitch clip quality to the lowest available when you open a new tab with a Twitch clip, ensuring a smoother experience on slow connections.

## Features
- Automatically sets Twitch clips to the lowest available quality (e.g., 360p)
- Works when opening new Twitch clip tabs
- Helps users with slow or unstable internet connections

## Installation
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Load the extension into your browser:
   - For Chrome-based browsers:
     1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
     2. Enable **Developer mode** (top-right corner)
     3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the extension folder

## Usage
- Simply install the extension, and it will automatically adjust Twitch clip quality whenever you open a new tab.
